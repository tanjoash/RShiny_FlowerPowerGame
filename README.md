## About
Welcome to the captivating world of Flower Power, a mesmerizing simulation game that puts you in charge of managing your very own floral empire.

### Background information
You have just opened a small floral business and have to make strategic decisions amidst changing demand and sudden surges on special occasions to maximise your profits. From choosing your reorder quantity of flowers and manpower to deciding which bouquets to make, you will have to juggle between inventory management and manpower, while being mindful that your flowers perish in just two days upon arrival. While you can strategize using the demand forecast, the randomly generated demand ensures a unique experience each time and challenges your ability to think fast and adapt. Compete with your friends to claim your place at the top of the leaderboard with the highest cash balance left at the end of the game!
